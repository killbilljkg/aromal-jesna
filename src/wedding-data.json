      "bio": "Born in Muscat but raised in the village of Meladoor, Thrissur, Jesna is a mix of calm vibes and an extroverted heart. After her school days at Holy Child and St. Antony’s Mala, she pursued her medical dreams at Govt Villupuram Medical College, Tamil Nadu. A true high-achiever, she has already cracked the UPSC, securing a position as a Railway Doctor—a testament to her dedication and brilliance. Currently, she is further specializing as a PG student in Anesthesia at Govt Medical College, Thrissur. To most, she comes across as calm and poised, but her inner circle knows her as a lively extrovert who loves a good laugh. She’s super ambitious about her career but stays deeply rooted in her family traditions. When she’s not navigating medical chaos, you’ll find her dancing or in her garden. For Jesna, life is about balance—working hard toward her goals while staying grounded in faith and family"
